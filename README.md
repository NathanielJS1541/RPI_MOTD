This is a customised version of raspberrypi-motd. If you are looking to create your own custom MOTD, or if you are looking for the origional it is located at
https://github.com/gagle/raspberrypi-motd. Full credit goes to Gabriel Llamas (https://github.com/gagle) for the code.

The scriptis written in bash so requires no external packages to be installed.

## Installation

Download and save the `motd.sh` bash script to the Raspberry Pi. It doesn't matter where it is. Remember to add execution permissions and change the owner:

```bash
$ sudo chown root:root motd.sh
$ sudo chmod +x motd.sh
```

The following steps may vary depending on the OS. Arch Linux ARM is assumed.

- Autoexecute the script when the user logs in. There are multiple locations from where you can start the `motd.sh` script, for example using the `/etc/profile`. More about [autostarting scripts](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash#Configuration_file_sourcing_order_at_startup).
  - Edit .profile for the current user:
    ```bash
    $ nano ~/.profile
    ```
  - Add the path to the motd.sh file at the bottom, for example add:
    ```bash
	# MOTD Script
	/home/nat/Documents/RPI_MOTD/motd.sh
	```
	to the end of the file.

- Rename the default MOTD. It is located in `/etc/motd`.
  
  ```bash
  $ sudo cp /etc/motd /etc/motd_OLD
  ```
  
- Remove the "last login" information. Disable the `PrintLastLog` option from the `sshd` service. Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and uncomment the line `#PrintLastLog yes`:
  
  ```bash
  $ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```
  
  Before:
  
  ```text
  #PrintLastLog yes
  ```
  
  After:
  
  ```text
  PrintLastLog no
  ```
  
  Restart the `sshd` service:
  
  ```bash
  $ sudo service ssh restart
  ```

## Troubleshooting

Note: If you don't see the degree Celsius character correctly (`ยบ`) make sure you have enabled a UTF8 locale ([Arch Linux locales](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale)).
